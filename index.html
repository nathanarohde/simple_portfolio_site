              <h4>Challenge:</h4>
              <p>Chico's, a fashion company targeting professional middle class women, decided to incorporate a product typeahead into their existing site design.</p>
              <h4>Action:</h4>
              <p>The design of the new typeahead was guided by:</p>
              <p>A) The fact Chico's sells visual merchandise.</p>
              <p>B) The objective that the product typeahead should help consumers refine search and ideally surface products before arriving at the search page.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <p>It should be noted this is only possible because of the strength of their product imagery due to the high quality work of their models and photographers.</p>
              &nbsp;
              <p>To achieve the objective a typeahead design consistent in appearance to their existing category and search pages was used with some minor changes.  Fewer data facets were displayed to allow for quicker scanning and an opaque layer was added behind the typeahead to allow the user to focus on the typeahead content.
              </p>
              <h4>Result:</h4>
              <p>Typeahead has been in use a year after a/b testing and implementation.</p>

              <h4>Challenge:</h4>
              <p>Carolina Bio, an established scientific supplies company with a dedicated long term professional consumer base, wanted to expand their typeahead from term suggestions to category suggestions, products, and resources without resizing their header.</p>
              <h4>Action:</h4>
              <p>The primary user personas of Carolina Bio were returning customers, teachers and lab researchers, repurchasing previously acquired materials.  In the case of teachers they would also frequently visit the site to acquire supporting educational materials.</p>

              <p>Therefore the primary objective of the typeahead was to serve as a memory prompt rather than a discovery tool.  Images were added for products, and icons were added to resources to allow user to easily identify the type of resource. </p>
              <h4>Result:</h4>
              <p>Typeahead in continuous use after a year.</p>
